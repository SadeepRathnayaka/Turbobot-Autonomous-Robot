## 3D Model Design

The robot chassis and components were designed in SolidWorks with a focus on robustness and simplicity. Key design features include:

- **Chassis**: Compact and durable, optimized for differential drive control.
- **Motors and Wheels**: Equipped with four 12V DC motors with encoders for precise movement and control.
- **Sensors**: Design accommodates IMU and encoders for accurate localization.

## ROS2 Framework Configuration

The robot is integrated with the ROS2 framework to enable advanced robotic functionalities. The configuration is divided into:

### 1. Turbobot Description Package
- **URDF File**: Created a URDF file from the Solidworks to accurately describe its physical structure.
- **RViz Visualization**: Used RViz2 for real-time visualization of the robot model and its movements.

### 2. Turbobot Controller Package
- **Differential Drive Controller**: Configured the ROS2 control package to manage differential drive mechanics and handle wheel commands.
- **Joint State Publishing**: Ensures real-time feedback of wheel states for visualization and control.

## ROS2 Localization with EKF

Localization is implemented using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) through the `robot_localization` package. This setup fuses sensor data to provide robust state estimation:

- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from wheel encoders and an IMU sensor.
- **EKF Implementation**: Filters noisy sensor data for accurate pose and velocity estimation.

---

## Turbobot Firmware Package

The firmware developed for the robot provides seamless communication between hardware and software:

- **Serial Communication**: Reads commands from ROS2 control via serial interface.
- **Encoder Feedback**: Sends wheel encoder data back to ROS2 control for real-time updates.

## Turbobot Bringup Package

The bringup package initializes and visualizes the robotâ€™s hardware or simulation:

- **Hardware Setup**: Launch file to start the physical robot.
- **Simulated Setup**: RViz2 integration to visualize and test the robot in a simulated environment.

## TODO

Future improvements and features:

1. Add a LiDAR sensor for environment scanning.
2. Integrate `nav2` and `slam_toolbox` for autonomous navigation and SLAM.
